                <div class="text-box">


                    <p> Narendra Modi was born in Vadnagar, Gujarat, on September 17, 1950, into a grocer family. He
                        claimed to have worked in his father's tea shop as a child, though there are disputes
                        regarding this. He completed his higher secondary education in 1967 and was known for his
                        debating skills and interest in theatre, influencing his political image. At eight, he
                        joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and had mentors like Lakshmanrao Inamdar. He
                        had an arranged but unconsummated marriage to Jashodaben, kept secret for years.

                        Modi's early years involved extensive travel through northern and northeastern India. In
                        1971, he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha and was briefly held in Tihar Jail for supporting
                        the Bangladesh Liberation War. After the 1971 war, he became a full-time RSS campaigner and
                        obtained BA and MA degrees amid controversies over their authenticity. These early
                        experiences and connections in Modi's life laid the groundwork for his later political
                        career, eventually leading him to become the Prime Minister of India in 2014.

                            Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) was launched by the Prime Minister on 22nd January, 2015 at

                            Parliament
                            from Varanasi, situated on the banks of Ganga in Uttar Pradesh. The River Ganga is important

                            only for its cultural and spiritual significance but also because it hosts more than 40% of

                        <p>India becomes the fastest growing large economy in the world under the NDA Government. It has
                            been a historic year for the Indian Economy. From a period of low growth, high inflation and
                            shrinking production, the NDA Government has not only strengthened our macro-economic
                            fundamentals, but has also propelled the economy to a higher growth trajectory. India’s GDP
                            Growth rocketed to 7.4%, which is the fastest among all the large economies of the world.
                            Various rating agencies and think tanks have predicted that India’s growth would accelerate

                            access to some means of protective Irrigation to all agricultural farms. Farmers are being
                            educated about modern irrigation methods to give 'Per Drop More Crop'. Paramparagat Krishi

                        <h3>Demonetisation in India</h3>
                        <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the decision to scrap high-value bank notes will
                            give the economy a further boost, and would provide long-term benefits, including forcing
                            the country’s vast shadow economy into the open.
                            Under the policy, both 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ceased to be legal tenders after December
                            31, 2016.
                            “We took the demonetisation decision not for some short-term windfall gain, but for a
                            long-term structural transformation,” Modi was quoted as saying by Economic Times.
                            Modi added the move would bring cash from the shadow economy into the mainstream. The Prime
                            Minister had said the demonetisation action was needed to fight corruption and fraud and cut
                            off financing for attacks by militants who target India.
                            “The multiplier effect of the introduction of money which was, till now, uselessly hoarded
                            and stocked away as cash into the active economic system will give the economy a further
                            boost,” he said. </p> <button>read more</button>

                        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the construction of a Hindu temple in the northern town
                            of Ayodhya, which is the birthplace of Lord Ram, after the Supreme Court ruled that Hindus
                            be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.

                            Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaigned for more than three decades for the
                            temple, unveiled a plaque at the site in an elaborate ceremony to inaugurate construction.

                        <p>President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the triple talaq bill passed by Parliament, turning
                            it into a law which made the practice of instant divorce among Muslims a punishable offence.

                            The law called The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 made

                        <h3>2016 Indian Line of Control strike</h3>
                        <p>On September 29, 2016, Indian Army commandos conducted a cross-border raid into
                            Pakistani-administered Kashmir, occurring in response to a militant attack on an Indian army
                            outpost in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers. Casualty
                            estimates from India's operation varied widely, with India claiming significant militant
                            casualties and Pakistan acknowledging the deaths of two soldiers. Pakistan initially denied
                            Indian troops had crossed the Line of Control, but later admitted to capturing an Indian
                            soldier. Independent analysts criticized India's casualty figures as exaggerated and
                            questioned the use of the term "surgical strike." The incident led to continued border
                            clashes and casualties in the following months, with media coverage reflecting nationalistic
                            perspectives and uncertainties surrounding the attack.</p>

                        <h3>2019 Balakot airstrike</h3>
                        <p>The 2019 Balakot airstrike involved Indian warplanes conducting a bombing raid on February
                            26, 2019, in Balakot, Pakistan, targeting an alleged terrorist training camp. Open-source
                            satellite imagery later revealed that no significant targets were hit. Pakistan shot down an
                            Indian warplane and took its pilot prisoner the next day, while an Indian helicopter was
                            accidentally downed by anti-aircraft fire, resulting in the deaths of several airmen.
                            India's ruling party used the airstrike to bolster its patriotic appeal during the April
                            2019 general elections. The airstrike marked the first time since the 1971 war that
                            warplanes crossed the Line of Control between India and Pakistan. Subsequent investigations
                            raised questions about the effectiveness of the strike, with no evidence of significant
                            damage found 47 days later on the alleged target.

                        <h3>2019 Pulwama attack</h3>
                        <p>On February 14, 2019, the Pulwama attack took place in the Pulwama district of the former
                            state of Jammu and Kashmir. A suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, targeted a convoy of Indian
                            Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, resulting in the deaths of 40 CRPF personnel.
                            The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed
                            terrorist group. India accused Pakistan of involvement, leading to strained relations and
                            the 2019 India-Pakistan military standoff. Indian investigations identified 19 suspects,
                            with some killed and others arrested. It was revealed that the Indian government had ignored
                            multiple intelligence warnings about the attack. Satya Pal Malik, the then-governor, alleged
                            that Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him to stay silent about security lapses.
